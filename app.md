# Restaurant Ordering and Management System

You are asked to develop a system to manage in-person dining at a restaurant, focusing on table management, online ordering from tables, kitchen order display, and end-of-meal payment processing.

## Key Features

### Menu Management
- Allows an administrator to add, edit, and delete menu items (including descriptions, prices, and images)

### Table Management
- Visual representation of table layout
- Assigning tables to servers

### Online Ordering
- Customers can browse the menu, add items to their order (associated with their table) and submit their order to the kitchen
- Customers can submit multiple orders throughout their meal

### Kitchen Order System (KOS)
- Displays incoming orders to the kitchen staff in a clear, chronological list, associated with the correct table number
- Kitchen staff can update the status of orders (e.g., "Preparing," "Ready") which is visible to staff/servers

### End-of-Meal Payment
- Customers can pay through the app or in person using cash or credit card
- If paying in person, a staff member records the payment method in the system and marks the bill as paid

### Inventory Management
- Tracking ingredient levels and notifying when stock is low

### Reporting
- Generating sales reports
- Identifying popular items

### Staff Management
- Managing employee schedules, roles, and permissions

## Implementation Requirements
Students are required to implement the complete online ordering module, including menu display, order placement, and a basic Kitchen Order System (KOS) that displays incoming orders to kitchen staff.
