// Description: Accessibility Best Practices for the Restaurant Management System

# Accessibility Best Practices

You are building an accessible restaurant management system that needs to work for all users, including those with disabilities.

## Core Accessibility Principles

- All images must have `alt` attributes describing their content or purpose
- Use semantic HTML elements (`nav`, `header`, `footer`, `button`, etc.) instead of generic divs
- Use proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) with only one h1 per page
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for text elements (WCAG AA standard minimum)
- Add appropriate ARIA attributes to interactive elements
- Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for elements without visible text
- Implement proper keyboard navigation and focus management
- Use native HTML elements (`button`, `a`, `input`) instead of custom elements where possible
- Ensure form controls have associated labels
- Add error messages for form validation that are announced to screen readers
- Use `tabIndex` sparingly and consider natural tab order
- Ensure functionality is available without requiring a mouse
- Implement focus styles that are visible and clear
- Create responsive designs that work at different zoom levels

## Dynamic Content Accessibility

- Use `aria-live` regions for announcements
- Update page titles when content changes significantly
- Announce loading states and completion to screen readers
- Use role attributes appropriately
- Implement proper focus management after UI updates

## Tables and Data Accessibility

- Use proper table markup with headers
- Associate data cells with headers
- Provide text alternatives for charts and graphs
- Add captions or summaries for complex data

## Modal and Overlay Accessibility

- Trap focus within modal dialogs
- Return focus to triggering element when closing
- Implement proper `aria-modal` attributes
- Ensure ESC key closes modals
